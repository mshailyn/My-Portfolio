## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Front-End

For this I included three pages that look like they are apart of one. I kept the background the same across the pages to increase uniformity and connection between the pages. I timed my transitions on the home page to showcase my welcome message and contrasted it with its own background but made it something a bit more translucent. The java script utilized was to add breakpoints and make sure certain parts of the opening site would pre-load so the initial transition would look smooth.

## Optimizations

I LOVE the way the gif as a background add a quality that makes the site feel alive but loading the gif does cause the website to initially run slow until it can be loaded. This is especially a problem for those with slower internet speeds. Would like to figure out how to make this smoother. 

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. I learned alot about making some smooth transition on this website. I wanted my website to feel alive yet maintain a level of fluidity. I think I was able to accomplish this but I will still continue to work on it as my knowledge grows.
